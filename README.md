# Student Code Grader

Student Code Grader is a C-based program that automates the process of grading C programming assignments for students.  
It reads a configuration file to obtain input files, expected output files, and a directory containing student submissions.  
The program then compiles, runs, and compares each student's output against the expected output. It then generates a CSV file with their respective grades and reasons for those grades.
